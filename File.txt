Iron Man , like knights of old , is identified by the armor he wears .
The best - dressed of the Marvel heroes , he has changed his look frequently since his debut in 1963 ,
but he can afford to : the man who wears the suits ( and designs them ) is wealthy inventor Tony Stark .
 So the man make the clothes , but do the clothes make the man ?

Not only does Tony Stark have no super powers of his own ,
but the armor that gives him strength was also created to keep his damaged heart beating ;
he could not survive without his iron shell . Eventually his cardiac condition was corrected by a heart transplant ,
and a later that left him paralyzed was repaired with a microchip .
So even without his high - tech costume Tony Stark is a mixture of man and machine, what science fiction writers call a cyborg .
